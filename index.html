        <h2>1. Home</h2>
        <p>Welcome to the official online home of Oussama Mellouli, Tunisia’s most decorated swimmer and a
            trailblazer in Olympic history. Known for his unparalleled endurance and versatility, Mellouli made
            waves by dominating both the pool and open water, a feat no swimmer had achieved before him. His
            crowning moment came at the 2008 Beijing Olympics, where he claimed gold in the grueling 1500m
            freestyle, etching his name into the annals of African and Arab sports history. Four years later, he
            defied expectations again, earning bronze in the 10km open-water marathon at the 2012 London
            Games—solidifying his legacy as a pioneer of long-distance swimming. This site celebrates his
            journey, from the shores of Tunis to the world’s biggest stages, and his ongoing mission to inspire
            future generations.</p>

        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>Oussama Mellouli’s story is one of relentless determination and groundbreaking achievements. Born in
            Tunis in 1984, he began swimming as a child and honed his talent at the University of Southern
            California (USC), where he became an NCAA champion. His breakthrough came in 2008 when he outpaced
            the world’s best to win Olympic gold in the 1500m freestyle—a victory that made him Tunisia’s first
            Olympic swimming champion. Never one to rest on his laurels, Mellouli reinvented himself as an
            open-water specialist, battling waves, cold, and rivals to medal in the 10km marathon at the 2012
            Olympics, a historic double no swimmer has replicated. Beyond the pool, he’s become a symbol of
            perseverance, returning to compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics at age 37 and advocating for
            swimming’s growth in Africa and the Arab world.</p>

        <h2>Work / Career Highlights</h2>
        <p>Mellouli’s career is a tapestry of historic firsts and jaw-dropping endurance. At the 2009 World
            Championships, he stunned audiences by winning gold in the 1500m, proving his Beijing victory was no
            fluke. Two years later, he transitioned to open water, claiming the 5km world title in Shanghai—a
            rare double that showcased his unmatched adaptability. His Olympic triumphs are the stuff of legend,
            but his consistency across decades is equally remarkable: from Pan Arab Games dominance to African
            records that still stand. Few athletes have thrived in such disparate disciplines, and fewer still
            have done it with Mellouli’s signature tenacity. Dive into his iconic races, from the tactical
            mastery of his 1500m wins to the brutal 10km battles where he outlasted younger rivals.</p>
